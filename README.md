# Winston's Portfolio 95
Explore my portfolio by visiting this [link](https://winstonsportfolio95.netlify.app/). The unique aesthetic of this portfolio is achieved through the integration of React95, providing Windows95 UI components for React applications, and react-draggable, enabling element drag-and-drop functionality.

Throughout the development of this portfolio, I delved into the intricacies of CSS and React JS, gaining valuable insights and refining my skills.

One challenge I encountered involved making both the parent and child components draggable. While this functionality works seamlessly on a traditional computer mouse, it may not function as expected on touchscreens. To address this, I implemented a workaround involving a separate element that tracks the parent's movement, allowing the child to follow suit and ensuring a smooth dragging experience on touchscreens.

An intriguing revelation in this process was the use of z-index to control the stacking order of positioned elements. While this property influences the stacking order among children and their parent within the same stacking context, it doesn't impact the stacking order of sibling elements.

Feel free to explore the portfolio and contact me for any junior role available!
